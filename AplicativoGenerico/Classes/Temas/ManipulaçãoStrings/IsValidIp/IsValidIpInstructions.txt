Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format.
IPs should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between 0 and 255, inclusive.

Valid inputs examples:

Examples of valid inputs:
1.2.3.4
123.45.67.89

Invalid input examples:
1.2.3
1.2.3.4.5
123.456.78.90
123.045.067.089
Notes:
Leading zeros (e.g. 01.02.03.04) are considered invalid
Inputs are guaranteed to be a single string


Enter: a string.
Exit: as boolean witch indicate that ip is valid or not.


Constrains:

1) Must have 4 dots.
2) Leading zeros are not allowed: Ex: 01
3) The values must be between 0 and 255 inclusive
